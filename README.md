Script that can analyse basic server performance stats.

Concisse write-up on how the code operates.
This script is designed to provide real-time insights into a Linux serverâ€™s performance by retrieving key system metrics. 
It helps in monitoring CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and identifying resource-heavy processes. 
By running this script, administrators can quickly assess system health and address potential performance issues. 
The script is lightweight and easy to use, making it a great tool for manual checks or automation through cron jobs.
(Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix and Linux systems that automates repetitive tasks by running scripts or commands at specified intervals.)

To use it, simply clone the repository, navigate to the script directory, make it executable, and run it. 
If automation is needed, the script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals using cron, ensuring continuous monitoring.

Below is the result of the code
